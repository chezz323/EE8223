## Abstract
With the advance of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, many industries use deep learning architecture to automate theirs with higher productivity. In the field of biomedical, it requires laborious work to detect and analyze biomedical images such as MRI, CT, and microscopic images, and experts usually do it. Especially variety of segmentation methods has been proposed for defining and detecting a region of interest in brain MR images. In this context, deep learning methods can help detect interested areas automatically and can be accomplished by segmenting such regions. Recently, a convolutional neural network conducted semantic segmentation successfully with outstanding performance. U-Net is a fully convolutional network developed for biomedical images and performs various biomedical datasets. In this paper, we implement semantic segmentation of brain MRI to detect tumors using UNet-based algorithms. By comparing several loss functions, we conclude that dice coefficient loss function produces the best results.
